# spcss
Project Aim: To analyse SharePoint 2010, 2013, and SharePoint Online CSS files; and creates .scss files with pseudo-classes, for easy branding.

Currently in proof of concept phase. 

Looking to develop using real test-driven development.

To try this, take some sharepoint CSS files and place them in test/mock_files

I am being quite careful not to redistribute any source from SharePoint 2013 - you will need to run the generator with your copies of the files.
